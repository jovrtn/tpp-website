<h3>TPP Eliminates Over 18,000 Taxes on Made-In-America Exports</h3>

<ul>

<li>In TPP countries, these taxes &ndash; known as tariffs &ndash; increase prices for American exports. For example, they raise prices by up to 59 percent for U.S. autos and up to 40 percent for U.S. poultry. This puts our workers and businesses at a global competitive disadvantage.</li>

<li>Eliminating these taxes on the cars, crops, and consumer goods that our workers produce will support American jobs and create new opportunities to sell to the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing markets.</li>

<li>Our domestic market is already open to the world. TPP tears down barriers to other markets so that we can compete.</li>
</ul>

<h3>TPP supports good middle class jobs at good wages</h3>

<ul>
<li>Made-in-America exports rose by nearly 50 percent and contributed nearly a third of our total economic growth from 2009 to 2014.</li>
<li>American exports are supporting a record number of American jobs&mdash;11.7 million, an increase of 1.8 million new jobs over the last 5 years.</li>
<li>TPP will increase U.S. exports and support higher-paying jobs. That is because every billion dollars of exports supports 5,800 jobs, on average.</li>
