<p>TPP includes the most robust enforceable environment commitments of any trade agreement in history. TPP requires countries to play by fair environmental rules if they want to send their goods to the United States, and upgrades NAFTA by putting fully enforceable environment obligations at the core of the agreement.</p>

<h3>HOW TPP PRESERVES THE ENVIRONMENT</h3>

<p>TPP helps improve conditions on the ground in TPP countries by requiring them to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fulfill their obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to <strong>protect and conserve iconic species</strong>, such as rhinos and elephants.</li>

<li><strong>For the first time in any trade agreement, prohibit harmful fisheries subsidies</strong>, including those that contribute to overfishing, and work to restrain new subsidy programs or enhancements to existing subsidy programs.</li>

<li><strong>Combat illegal fishing</strong>, <strong>promote sustainable fisheries management</strong> practices, and protect wetlands and important natural areas.</li>

<li><strong>Promote the long-term conservation of whales, dolphins, sharks, sea turtles</strong>, and other marine species at risk.</li>

<li><strong>Combat wildlife trafficking, illegal logging</strong>, and <strong>illegal fishing</strong> through enhanced national and regional actions.</li>
<li><strong>Protect the marine environment</strong> from ship pollution, including by implementing their obligations under MARPOL (an international agreement to prevent marine pollution).</li>
</ul>
