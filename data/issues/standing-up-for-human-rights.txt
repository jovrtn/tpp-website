<p>TPP also provides an opportunity to promote our values. This includes promoting and protecting human rights, which is a core value of the Obama Administration. Through the commitments in TPP, we can press to ensure that people everywhere are treated with dignity and respect.</p>

<h3>HOW TPP STANDS UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS</h3>

<p>TPP helps improve respect for human rights in TPP countries by:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Prohibiting exploitative</strong> <strong>child labor and forced labor</strong>, giving workers a voice by protecting <strong>freedom of association</strong> and collective bargaining, prohibiting employment discrimination and <strong>combatting trade in goods made by forced labor</strong> in countries both inside and outside of TPP.</li>
<li><strong>Bringing workers out of the shadows.</strong> Earnings are consistently lower and working hours longer in the informal sector, and informal-sector work is particularly common in developing countries. But research by the International Labor Organization and the World Trade Organization finds that <strong>combining expanded trade opportunities with strong protections for workers can help workers move from informal-sector jobs into formal work</strong> in wage-paying, regulated export industries which offer a minimum wage, benefits, and safety programs. TPP will combine economic growth opportunities with strong labor protections to help improve the lives of workers across the region.</li>
<li><strong>Improving governance by increasing transparency and anti-corruption efforts</strong>. TPP helps encourage good governance by promoting transparency and encouraging public participation in the rulemaking process. TPP also seeks to discourage corruption and establish codes of conduct to promote high ethical standards among public officials. Research also shows that trade improves human rights conditions by fostering pluralistic institutions and increasing open exchanges of information.</li>
<li><strong>Promoting development</strong>. For the first time in any trade agreement, TPP includes a development chapter that helps parties align their development efforts, including to help women workers and businesses owners take advantage of TPP&rsquo;s benefits; promote education, science and technology, research and innovation; and enhance broad-based economic growth.</li>
<li><strong>Addressing poverty and raising real incomes</strong>. Expanded trade can fuel growth, facilitate investment, spur development, and reduce poverty. This translates into better jobs and increased incomes for the poor.</li>
</ul>
