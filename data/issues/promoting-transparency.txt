<p>The Administration has taken unprecedented steps to increase transparency of our TPP negotiations to maximize input from key stakeholders, including labor and environmental groups.  These steps have resulted in more diverse input, public dialogue, and outreach than on any trade agreement in history. </p>

<h3>HOW WE HAVE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IN TPP</h3>

<ul>
<li>Supported provisions in the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation governing Congressional consideration of TPP that require the <strong>text of the agreement</strong> to be made <strong>available online to the public at least 60 days before the President signs it.</strong></li>

<li>Published <strong>detailed summaries of U.S. objectives</strong> in negotiating all aspects of the agreement.</li>

<li><strong>Solicited public comments</strong> on negotiating aims, priorities, and concerns.</li>

<li><strong>Held public hearings</strong> inviting input on the negotiations.</li>

<li>Consulted with and sought advice from Members of Congress and staff, including by holding over <strong>1,800 Congressional briefings</strong> on TPP.</li>

<li>Ensured that <strong>every Member of Congress was able to review full TPP text</strong> in the Capitol with staff members during the negotiation process (including elements that were still under negotiation).</li>

</ul>
