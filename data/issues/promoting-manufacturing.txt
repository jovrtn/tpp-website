<p>TPP allows us to write rules of the road that level the playing field for American workers, support American manufacturing jobs, and help us export more ‘Made-in-America’ manufactured goods across the world. </p>

<h3>HOW TPP BENEFITS U.S. MANUFACTURING</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Eliminates all foreign taxes in the form of tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods</strong> exported to TPP countries, including rates as high as 70 percent on automobiles in Vietnam.</li>

<li><strong>Prevents other TPP countries from maintaining, expanding, or creating new trade barriers</strong> to American manufacturers as they eliminate tariffs.</li>

<li>Some countries require exporters to acquire licenses before they can send their goods to that country. TPP ensures that <strong>exporters have updated and complete information about import licensing requirements</strong> so that they cannot be used as trade barriers, which can hurt U.S. workers and businesses and provide foreign companies with unfair advantages.</li>

<li>Rules of origin allow us to determine if a good is a genuine TPP good. <strong>TPP establishes rules of origin that provide incentives for companies to keep production and manufacturing jobs in the United States</strong>.</li>

<li>Helping to <strong>prevent long delays in customs processing</strong> for U.S. products</li>

<li>Eliminates trade barriers and <strong>creating export opportunities for U.S. auto manufacturers in the Japanese market.</strong></li>

</ul>
