<p>TPP is an opportunity to set better standards for food safety. TPP promotes the use of transparent and science-based rules, and allows the United States to help TPP countries improve their food safety systems. At the same time, TPP does not require any changes to U.S. food safety laws or regulations. </p>

<h3>HOW TPP ENSURES FOOD SAFETY</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ensuring the ability of U.S. and other TPP regulatory agencies to <strong>regulate for the protection of food safety and plant and animal health</strong>.</li>

<li>Ensuring food safety measures are developed and implemented in a <strong>science-based manner</strong>, as we do in the United States.</li>

<li><strong>Enhancing transparency</strong> in the development of food safety measures.</li>

<li>Establishing tough customs provisions and provisions on rules of origin to help the U.S. <strong>combat illegal transshipments, including those of seafood</strong>.</li>

<li>Developing a consultative mechanism for regulatory experts to <strong>resolve food safety issues </strong>in a timely fashion.</li>

<li>Making most food safety obligations <strong>enforceable through a dispute settlement process</strong> should the consultative mechanism not be successful.</li>
</ul>
