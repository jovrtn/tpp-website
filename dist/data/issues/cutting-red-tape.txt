<p>TPP ensures that trade in goods among TPP countries is efficient, with effective and transparent procedures that help move goods as quickly as possible across borders. This is particularly important to small and medium-sized businesses, which often find complex customs and border procedures among the most serious obstacles to increasing their exports.  </p>

<h3>HOW TPP STREAMLINES CUSTOMS PROCEDURES AND CUTS RED TAPE</h3>

<p>TPP reduces costs for legitimate traders; strengthens enforcement at the border; and provides benefits to small businesses, for whom paperwork costs and delays can make the difference between being competitive or not. TPP requires countries to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Publish all customs laws, regulations, and procedures on the Internet,</strong> including in English whenever possible.</li>

<li>Ensure that to the greatest extent possible, <strong>shipments move through ports within a time period no longer than necessary to comply with customs laws</strong>, and countries provide advance rulings on valuation and other matters to <strong>avoid unnecessary delays on arrival.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Provide expedited customs treatment to express delivery shipments</strong>, and set &lsquo;<em>de minimis</em>&rsquo; levels for low-value shipments under which customs will not impose tariffs.</li>

<li><strong>Strengthen cooperation against illegal trade in counterfeit goods, wildlife trafficking, and goods illegally transshipped</strong> through TPP countries from third countries to evade tariffs.</li>

<li><strong>Administer customs penalties impartially</strong>, with rules to avoid conflicts of interest.</li>

</ul>
