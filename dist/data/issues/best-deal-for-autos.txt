<p>When President Obama took office, the American auto industry was shedding jobs by the hundreds of thousands. Today – thanks to the Administration’s support – the industry is once again leading the world, and the U.S. auto industry has added over 600,000 jobs since mid-2009, the industry's strongest growth on record. TPP will build on that strong performance by unlocking new opportunities for exports of ‘Made-in-America’ parts, cars and trucks. </p>

<ul>
<li>TPP presents a <strong>significant growth opportunity for U.S. auto exports</strong>. Historically, U.S. auto exporters have faced a broad range of formidable barriers to export in TPP countries, particularly in Japan. TPP addresses these barriers.</li>


<li>TPP <strong>eliminates foreign taxes in the form of tariffs </strong>on exports of Made-in-America cars and trucks. That includes eliminating Malaysia&rsquo;s 30% foreign tax on autos, and Vietnam&rsquo;s foreign tax of 70% on autos.</li>

<li>TPP and a U.S.-Japan bilateral agreement also <strong>address the wide range of non-tariff measures in Japan</strong> that have kept U.S.-made autos, trucks, and parts out of this important market, including <strong>transparency in regulations, standards, certification, financial incentives, and distribution</strong>.</li>

</ul>
