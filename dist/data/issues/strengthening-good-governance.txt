<P>
The U.S. has an unprecedented opportunity to raise good governance standards across the Asia-Pacific through TPP.  If we do not take the lead, we risk ceding leadership to other countries that do not share our commitment to these values. Better governance translates into stronger economies, sustainable growth, and a more conducive environment for U.S. investment and trade. In TPP, we have set a new high standard for action against corruption through a trade agreement, including commitments to adopt, maintain, and enforce criminal laws to deter corruption by public officials, to maintain codes of conduct to promote integrity among public officials, to adopt laws criminalizing corruption in accounting practice, and to effectively enforce anti-corruption laws.
