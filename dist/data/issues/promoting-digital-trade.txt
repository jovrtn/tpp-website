<p>The power of the digital marketplace is its reach: any business or entrepreneur can sell anywhere in the world to anyone with an Internet connection.  TPP expands opportunities for individuals and businesses to deliver their goods and services over the Internet, and helps ensure that U.S. innovation can continue to thrive in the global marketplace.</p>

<h3>WHY TPP BENEFITS DIGITAL TRADE</h3>

<p>TPP includes strong rules that make sure the best innovation, not trade barriers and censorship laws, shapes how digital markets grow. TPP helps preserve the single, global, digital marketplace by:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Preventing Data Localization.</strong> The cloud should be global, and you should be able choose where you store your data. We&rsquo;ve already seen a troubling trend of countries practicing &ldquo;digital protectionism&rdquo;, and trying to make keeping data onshore the cost of doing business. That&rsquo;s not just costly for small business, it will also have the effect of leaving countries behind. TPP prevents those kinds of arbitrary requirements.</li>

<li><strong>Prohibiting Digital Customs Duties. </strong>It&rsquo;s common sense that you shouldn&rsquo;t try to put a duty stamp on a packet of data. TPP ensures that customs duties do not impede the flow of music, video, software, and games throughout the region.</li>

<li><strong>Enabling Cross-Border Data Flows. </strong>And it&rsquo;s not just music, video, software and game products that depend on data flows &ndash; so do all companies that interact with consumers, help people find products, or facilitate communication through the Internet. TPP protects the movement of that data &ndash; with room for appropriate safeguards, including for privacy.</li>

<li><strong>Sustaining Cybersecurity &amp; Encryption. </strong>Some countries are even blocking the use of technologies like encryption or VPN, claiming these basic cybersecurity tools threaten national security. The TPP region will be a better place to do digital business, because parties will not be permitted to put those arbitrary restrictions in place, and governments will cooperate on cyber security.</li>

<li><strong>Barring Forced Technology Transfers</strong>. U.S. companies should not have to hand over their source code or proprietary algorithms to their competitors, or a regulator that will then pass it along to a State-owned enterprise. TPP ensures that that you don&rsquo;t have to give up trade secrets or substitute local technology into your products and services, in order to access new markets.
