<p>The power of the Internet rests in ensuring that anyone who is connected can reap its benefits.  But under new forms of protectionism, we’ve seen unprecedented attempts to roll back Internet freedom and access to U.S. products and services.  That’s why TPP puts in place strong rules that make sure the best communications tools and platforms are not unduly limited by trade barriers and laws that restrict the flow of data and information.</p>

<h3>HOW TPP PROTECTS THE INTERNET AND ENSURES DIGITAL FREEDOM</h3>

<ul>

<li>Preserves the right of individuals, small businesses, and others to <strong>access and move data</strong> as they see fit, subject to safeguards, such as <strong>privacy protections</strong>, which helps ensure the <strong>free flow of global information</strong> and data that drive the Internet and the digital economy.</li>

<li><strong>Reflects the appropriately strong copyright protections and enforcement that we have in U.S. law</strong>, and also reflects the TPP Parties&rsquo; commitment to <strong>continuously seek to achieve an appropriate balance in their copyright systems</strong>. TPP doesn&rsquo;t go beyond U.S. law &ndash; for example, TPP does not establish new enforcement methods that meddle with Internet architecture. TPP also establishes the kind of certainty ISPs have requested in copyright safe harbor systems, such as an assurance that safe harbors are not to be conditioned on a duty that ISPs monitor their systems for infringement, as well as other safeguards.</li>

<li>Ensures that companies and individuals are able to <strong>use the cybersecurity and encryption tools they see fit</strong>, without arbitrary restrictions that could stifle free expression.</li>

<li>Promotes <strong>public participation and transparency </strong>in the development of laws and regulations affecting the Internet, including with opportunities for public comment.<br /> </li>
<li>Requires countries to adopt and maintain <strong>consumer protection laws</strong> related to fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities online; ensure enforcement of privacy and other consumer protections; and enact measures to stop unsolicited commercial electronic messages.</li>
</ul>
