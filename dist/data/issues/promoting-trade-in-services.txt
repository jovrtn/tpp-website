<p>TPP opens markets for America’s service providers and their workers – industries that include entertainment and film, express delivery and logistics, Internet and software services, professional services, financial services, scientific research and development, engineering, telecom, and others. TPP’s strong and enforceable commitments will give our businesses and workers enhanced access to the estimated 500 million consumers in the region, including improved access to 3 of the top 5 importers of American services.</p>

<h3>HOW TPP BENEFITS U.S. SERVICES SUPPLIERS</h3>

<p>TPP opens markets to U.S. services, prevents discrimination against American firms, and encourages high-quality regulatory policies abroad by requiring TPP countries to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Open their markets</strong> so that U.S. businesses and workers can compete fairly, and ensure that <strong>regulations do not discriminate</strong> against U.S. services suppliers.</li>

<li><strong>Guarantee equal treatment to services provided in different ways</strong>, whether it is through physical investment or over the Internet (subject to public-interest regulation).</li>

<li>Ensure that regulators have the ability to fulfill <strong>valid public-interest goals</strong> (for example, promoting financial stability).</li>

<li>Create rules ensuring <strong>transparency for development of new regulations</strong>, including with opportunities to comment and respond to stakeholder inquiries.</li>

<li><strong>Ensure that TPP benefits are not open to &lsquo;shell companies&rsquo; </strong>controlled by non-TPP countries, and address the unique challenges private-sector services suppliers such as express delivery companies face when competing against State-Owned Enterprises and government monopolies.</li>

</ul>
